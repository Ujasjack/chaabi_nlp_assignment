Certainly! Here's an updated `README.md` file with instructions on how to use the provided `test.py` script to interact with your FastAPI endpoint:

```markdown
# Conversational Chat API

This FastAPI-based API provides an endpoint for conversational chat using a combination of language models and retrieval chains. ```

# Setup

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the FastAPI application:

   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

The API will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

## Endpoints

### `/ask`

- **Method:** POST
- **Request Body:**

  ```json
  {
    "user_input": "Your user input text here"
  }
  ```

- **Response:**

  ```json
  {
    "response": "The model's response"
  }
  ```

## Usage Example

To interact with the API, you can use the provided `test.py` script. Make sure your FastAPI application is running before executing the script.

### Execute the Test Script

```bash
python test.py
```

The script sends a sample question to the `/ask` endpoint and prints the API response. Ensure that the `api_url` variable in `test.py` is set to the correct URL where your FastAPI app is running.

Example output:

```bash
API Response:
{'response': 'Fructis Serum'}
```

Feel free to customize and extend the provided script for your testing purposes.

This updated README includes a new section on how to use the provided `test.py` script to interact with your FastAPI endpoint. Adjust the instructions as needed based on your specific project details.
